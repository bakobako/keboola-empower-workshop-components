## Step 04: Create a component repository in GitHub

This step is very simple. Just go to your GitHub and create a new repository. Name the repository with the ID of the
component you generated in the previous step, e.g. my-vendor.ex-demo-component.
It is most common to keep components public, so Keboola staff can view the repository during publishing and others can
help you maintain the code and generate issues and fixes.
