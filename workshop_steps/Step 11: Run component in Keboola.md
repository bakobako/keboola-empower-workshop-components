## Step 11: Run component in Keboola

To run the component in Keboola you must add the unlisted component to your project. The easiest way to do this is to 
open your keboola project and go to the components page, for example this is what your URL will look like


https://connection.north-europe.azure.keboola.com/admin/projects/13513/components/configurations


Once there take the ID of the component, e.g. my-vendor.ex-demo-component. and put it in place of the "configurations" text


https://connection.north-europe.azure.keboola.com/admin/projects/13513/components/my-vendor.ex-demo-component


There you can then create a new configuration of your unlisted/unpublished component and run it after configuring it.
