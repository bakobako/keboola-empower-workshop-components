## Step 3: Register a component in the Developer Portal

To register a component you will need a [Keboola Developer Account and vendor](https://developers.keboola.com/extend/component/tutorial/#before-you-start). 
Go to your account and add a new component.

After you add the component, specify the name of the component.
The name should be as short as possible specifying the service you are going to integrate, e.g. Salesforce, BigQuery, Google Sheets. 
Then specify the type of component in the component type section.

In this case :
* Name : OpenAI
* Type : Application

Once all are filled in, your component ID will be generated, and you can add the component.
